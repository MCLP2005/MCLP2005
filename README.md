# MCLP2005 a.k.a. StillerMarcel or Eric Marcel Stiller
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Who am I?
I am a student in 12th grade. Currently I live in Bremerhaven, Bremen, Germany.<br>
I am very interested in computer science. <br>
As a school project i worked in a group of 3 on a website for a game some people could know - cards against humanity. Of course there was already a website, there was already an online version of that game, but luckily it didn't matter. So we started the project, finished it like after 5 months and got full points. So I think it was more about the learning.
## What am I doing on GitHub?
I guess, I could say, currently nothing much. I look out for storys to add to my profile and if there are ideas I have, I note them down and if I have the time, I guess I start them.
## What am I currently working on?
I guess I'll have to finish school. That would be one important thing for me to do first.<br>
When I'm done with school, I have to find a place, where I can be a trainee first. If I have time after that, I'll get to work on my projects or something.<br> Also I'll write my ideas down in my repository [**.ideas**](https://github.com/MCLP2005/.ideas)
